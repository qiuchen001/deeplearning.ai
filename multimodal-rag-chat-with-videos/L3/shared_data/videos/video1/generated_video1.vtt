00:00.000 --> 00:08.780
 As I look back on the mission that we've had here on the International Space Station,

00:08.780 --> 00:13.300
 I'm proud to have been a part of much of the science activities that happened over the

00:13.300 --> 00:14.300
 last two months.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.180
 The view is always amazing though.

00:16.180 --> 00:21.260
 I didn't think I would do another spacewalk and to now have the chance to have done four

00:21.260 --> 00:25.100
 more was just icing on the cake for a wonderful mission.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.100
 The tenth one, do you like the first one?

00:27.100 --> 00:28.100
 No.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.300
 A little more comfortable on your tenth one.

00:30.300 --> 00:36.980
 It's hard to put into words just what it was like to be a part of this expedition, the

00:36.980 --> 00:37.980
 Expedition 63.

00:37.980 --> 00:42.280
 It'll be kind of a memory that will last a lifetime for me.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.780
 It's been a true honor.

00:43.780 --> 00:46.860
 Dragon Space X, Undock sequence commanded.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.340
 The roster's looking good.

00:48.340 --> 00:52.940
 The hardest part was getting us launched, but the most important part is bringing us home.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.100
 I've been telling Daddy we love you.

00:59.100 --> 01:03.100
 Hurry home so we can go get my dog.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.100
 Flashdown.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.100
 Welcome back to Planet Earth and thanks for flying Space X.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.100
 It's truly our honor and privilege.

01:13.100 --> 01:18.100
 Space dads are back on Earth after a 19 hour return journey from space.
